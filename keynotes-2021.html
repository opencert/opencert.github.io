<h2>Concurrency and Objects Matter: Disentangling the Fabric of Real Operational Processes</h2>
<h3 style="color:#B40431;">Abstract</h3>
<p>Process mining dramatically changed the way we look at process models and operational processes.
	Even seemingly simple processes like Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) and Order-to-Cash (O2C) are often amazingly complex,
	and traditional hand-made process models fail to capture the true fabric of such processes.
	Many processes are inherently concurrent and involve interaction between different objects
	(customers, suppliers, orders, items, shipments, payments, machines, workers, etc.). 
	Process mining uses event data to construct process models that can be used to diagnose performance and compliance problems.
	If such models reflect reality well, they can be used for forward-looking forms of process mining,
	including predictive analytics, evidence-based automation, and what-if simulation.
	The ultimate goal is to create a ``digital twin'' that can be used to explore different improvement actions.
	In his keynote, Wil van der Aalst will provide an overview of process mining and the spectacular developments in the field.
	Currently, there are over 35 process mining companies (including Celonis with is the highest-valued startup in Germany)
	and most of the larger European firms have applied process mining.
	Despite the successes and mature tools, some of the foundational problems remain "unsolved" and will block future progress.
	Therefore, the keynote highlights the challenges related to concurrency and objects in process mining.</p>

<p>Prof.dr.ir. Wil van der Aalst is a full professor at RWTH Aachen University leading the Process and Data Science (PADS) group.
	He is also part-time affiliated with the Fraunhofer-Institut für Angewandte Informationstechnik (FIT) where
	he leads FIT's Process Mining group and the Technische Universiteit Eindhoven (TU/e).
	Until December 2017, he was the scientific director of the Data Science Center Eindhoven (DSC/e) and
	led the Architecture of Information Systems group at TU/e. Since 2003, he holds a part-time position at
	Queensland University of Technology (QUT).
	Currently, he is also a distinguished fellow of Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) in Trento and a member of the Board of Governors
	of Tilburg University.
	His research interests include process mining, Petri nets, business process management, workflow management, process modeling,
	and process analysis. Wil van der Aalst has published over 250 journal papers, 22 books (as author or editor),
	550 refereed conference/workshop publications, and 80 book chapters.
	Many of his papers are highly cited (he one of the most cited computer scientists in the world; according to Google Scholar,
	he has an H-index of 155 and has been cited over 115,000 times), and his ideas have influenced researchers, software developers,
	and standardization committees working on process support. Next to serving on the editorial boards of over ten scientific journals,
	he is also playing an advisory role for several companies, including Fluxicon, Celonis, aiConomix, and UiPath.
	Van der Aalst received honorary degrees from the Moscow Higher School of Economics (Prof. h.c.), Tsinghua University, and
	Hasselt University (Dr. h.c.). He is also an IFIP Fellow, IEEE Fellow, ACM Fellow, and an elected member of the
	Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Royal Holland Society of Sciences and Humanities, the Academy of Europe,
	and the North Rhine-Westphalian Academy of Sciences, Humanities and the Arts (Nordrhein-Westfälische Akademie der Wissenschaften
	und der Künste).
	In 2018, he was awarded an Alexander-von-Humboldt Professorship.</p>
