<h2>BlockAdemiC: An Approach for Open Certification of Micro-Credentials</h2>
<h3 id="dark">Abstract</h3>
<p>BlockAdemiC project mission is to create a digital open and 
distributed cybersecurity system for the certification and 
verification of educational activities, qualifications and skills in 
the field of higher education and lifelong learning, creating an 
inviolable educational passport. The approach is based on the 
specification and monitoring of learners' activities on a learning 
management system. Successful completion of assignments that prove the 
learners' knowledge and skills on a particular subject are registered 
on a dedicated blockchain. The approach is exemplified through the 
certification of students participating in an open source project in 
the context of a postgraduate course.

<h3 id="dark">Abstract</h3>
<p>
The acceptance and use of open source software (OSS) has grown
exponentially over the past two decades. Many companies that once
criticized even the concept of OSS have changed their position,
and are now strong supporters and advocates for OSS.
However, this acceptance is much more widespread among software
developers in high tech companies than it is in the broader community.
Government agencies, non-profits, and companies focused on manufacturing
and consumer goods have been much slower to adopt OSS, and rely heavily
on proprietary software, both to run on their premises and as hosted
applications in the cloud.
<br>
These organizations are not well connected to the OSS community,
and need help to learn about OSS and how it can help them.
Beyond that, they need assistance in finding high-quality OSS that
is well-suited for business-critical needs, and evaluating it against
proprietary applications.
This talk explains their situation more fully, and describes available
resources for learning about OSS, as well as techniques for finding
and evaluating OSS and the business case for using OSS.
