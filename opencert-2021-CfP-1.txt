PAPER SUBMISSION DEADLINE: TBA
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The concept of Open Community extends the idea of Open Source to other
collaborative frameworks. It includes Open Content, under a form of non-restrictive 
license, and Open Knowledge, that is, the freedom to use, reuse, and redistribute
knowledge without legal, social or technological restrictions.

The 10th International Workshop on Open Community approaches to Education, Research
and Technology expands the scope of the International Workshop on Foundations and
Techniques for Open Source Software Certification, whose 8 editions run from 2007
to 2014.

The workshop promotes the use of Open Community approaches in Education and
Research, with the aim to achieve wide diffusion and proper assessment of new,
innovative Technology. 

The workshop general focus is on

1. EDUCATION, where aspects of interest are all those related to open and
collaborative learning, in both formal and informal education contexts. 

2. RESEARCH, with the aims at

* establishing open research projects as "cauldrons" of open data, open knowledge
  and collaborative development, as well as devising methodologies and tools for
  the management and assessment of such projects;
* defining open peer-review methodologies for the assessment of research outputs
  and appropriate bibliometrics based on the community open feedback rather than
  on a questionable analysis of citations;
* defining, more specifically, quality metrics and a formal process to certify open
  source software (OSS) products and the outcomes of other peer-production efforts.

3. TECHNOLOGY, by fostering and unleashing the efforts of open communities towards
global availability and acceptance of new technologies. Prominent interests, here,
are in supporting the open communities during the production process, and in the
validation of the information produced, or made available, by such communities,
especially in the case of advices provided by thematic communities, such as the
user/consumer support/review communities.

This year OpenCERT is collocated with SEFM, so contributions connected to the
themes of FORMAL METHODS and SOFTWARE ENGINEERING will be particularly
appreciated. In addition to the thematic description provided above, we will
be also interested in the following aspects: 
1. EDUCATION: open and collaborative approaches in Software Engineering and
   in Formal Methods education;
2. RESEARCH: open community research in Formal Methods, formal modelling of
   learning and collaboration
3. TECHNOLOGY, integrating Formal Methods technologies and tools within OSS
   projects as a means for Formal Methods acceptance and diffusion;

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Authors are invited to submit, via EasyChair research contributions or experience
reports (https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=opencert2023#).

All papers should be written in English and prepared using the specific LNCS
templates available at http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html.

There are nine categories of submissions

RESEARCH PAPERS to present original research and the analysis, interpretation and
validation of the research findings.

POSITION PAPERS to present innovative, arguable ideas, opinions or frameworks
which are likely to foster discussion at the workshop.

PROJECT PAPERS to describe a new open community project (e.g. on a hosting provider
or a dedicated portal) or a new research project, or the status of an ongoing
project or the outcomes of a recently completed project.

SURVEY PAPERS to collect previously published studies on topics related to the
workshop and analyse them in the context of open communities.

CASE STUDY PAPERS to report on case studies, preferably in a real-world setting.

TOOL PAPERS to present a new tool, a new tool component or novel extensions to an
existing tool aiming at supporting open community approaches, or the
use/customisation of an existing tool in the context of open communities.

TOOL DEMONSTRATION PAPERS to demonstrate the tool workflow(s) and human interaction
aspects, and evaluate the overall role of the tool in supporting open community
approaches.

TEACHING EXPERIENCE PEPERS to report on teaching experiences using an open community
approach in a formal education context (e.g. in a university/school context) or in
informal education.

LEARNING EXPERIENCE PAPERS to report on a learning experience within an open
community in a formal education context (e.g. by university students) or in informal
education.

Contributions will be in the form of

* FULL PAPERS between 12 and 15 pages excluding references for submission
  (and between 12 and 17 pages excluding references for post-proceedings camera-ready).
* SHORT PAPERS between 6 and 8 pages excluding references for submission
  (and between 6 and 9 pages excluding references for post-proceedings camera-ready).
* PRESENTATIONS extended abstract up to 4 pages, which will be included in the
  pre-proceeding but not published in the post-proceedings.

"Short papers" and "Presentations" can discuss new ideas which are at an early stage
of development and which have not yet been thoroughly evaluated.

The program committee may reject papers that are outside the above mentioned length
limits.

Submitted papers will be refereed for quality, correctness, originality and
relevance. All submitted papers will be posted on GitHub at

	https://github.com/opencert/workshop-2023/

and the review process will be carried out as an interactive, open discussion
between the authors and the reviewers. Final decisions about acceptance/rejection
of papers will be made through a closed discussion among the PC members.
Notification and reviews will be communicated via email.
Accepted papers (both "Regular papers" and "Short papers") will be included in the
workshop programme and will appear in the workshop pre-proceedings as well as in
the LNCS post-proceedings.
Pre-proceedings will be available online before the Workshop.
