                        to other collaborative efforts.
                        It includes Open Content, that is, some form of non restrictive licence, and Open Knowledge,
                        that is, the freedom to use, reuse, and redistribute knowledge without legal, social or
                        technological restriction.
                        The 9th International Workshop on Open Community approaches to Education, Research and Technology
                        expands ther scope of the International Workshop on Foundations and Techniques for
                        Open Source Software Certification, whose 8 editions run from 2007 to 2014.
                        The new scope of the workshop aims to promote the use of Open Community approaches in
                        Education and Research while also exploiting them to achieve wide diffusion and proper assessment
                        of new, innovative Technology.
                        The workshop general focus is on
                        <ol class="text">
                        <li><b>Education</b>, by exploring forms of open learning and collaborative learning in both formal
                          and informal education contexts, as well as the use of peer reviewing and strategies and methods
                          to ensure (and aiming at certifying) that such use guarantees a proper and fair assessment;</li>
                        <li><b>Research</b>, by aiming at
                          <ul class='text'>
                            <li>establishing open research projects as “cauldrons” of open data, open knowledge and
                              collaborative development, as well as devising metodologies and tools for the management and
                              assessment of such projects;</li>
                            <li>defining open peer-review methodologies for the assessment of research outputs and
                              appropriate bibliometrics based on the community open feedback rather than on a questionable
                              analysis of citations;</li>
                            <li> defining, more specifically, quality metrics and a formal process to certify open source

                          </ul></li>
                        <li><b>Technology</b>, on the one hand by fostering and exploiting open communities to make
                          new technologies globally available and accepted and, on the other hand, to support such communities
                          in the production process and to certify the information and data produced or made publicly available
                          by such communities, especially in the case of advices provided by thematic communities and
                          user/consumer support/review communities.</li>

<p class="text">"Short papers" and "Presentations" can discuss new ideas which are at an early stage of development
  and which have not yet been thoroughly evaluated.</p>
<p class="text">The program committee may reject papers that are outside these lengths on the
grounds of length alone.</p>
<p class="text">Submitted papers will be refereed for quality, correctness, originality and relevance.
All submitted papers will be posted on GitHub at <a

href="https://github.com/opencert/workshop-2019/">https://github.com/opencert/workshop-2019/</a>
and the review process will be carried out as an interactive, open discussion between the authors and the reviewers.
Final decisions about acceptance/rejection of papers will be made through a closed discussion among the PC members.
Notification and reviews will be communicated via email.
Accepted papers will be included in the workshop programme and will appear
in the workshop pre-proceedings.
Pre-proceedings will be available online before the Workshop.
