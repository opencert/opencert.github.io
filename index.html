                        collaborative frameworks. 
                        It includes Open Content, under a form of non-restrictive license, and Open Knowledge,
                        that is, the freedom to use, reuse, and redistribute knowledge without legal, social or
                        technological restrictions.
                        The 10th International Workshop on Open Community approaches to Education, Research and Technology
                        expands ther scope of the International Workshop on Foundations and Techniques for
                        Open Source Software Certification, whose 8 editions run from 2007 to 2014.
                        The workshop promotes the use of Open Community approaches in Education and Research, with the aim
                        to achieve wide diffusion and proper assessment of new, innovative Technology. 
                        The workshop general focus is on
                        <ol class="text">
                        <li><b>Education</b>, where aspects of interest are all those related to open and collaboratve learning,
                          in both formal and informal education contexts.;</li>
                        <li><b>Research</b>, with the aims at
                          <ul class='text'>
                            <li>establishing open research projects as “cauldrons” of open data, open knowledge and
                              collaborative development, as well as devising metodologies and tools for the management and
                              assessment of such projects;</li>
                            <li>defining open peer-review methodologies for the assessment of research outputs and
                              appropriate bibliometrics based on the community open feedback rather than on a questionable
                              analysis of citations;</li>
                            <li> defining, more specifically, quality metrics and a formal process to certify open source
                              software (OSS) products and the outcomes of other peer-production efforts.</li>
                          </ul></li>
                        <li><b>Technology</b>, by fostering and unleashing the efforts of open communities towards global
                          availability and acceptance of new technologies. Prominent interests, here, are in supporting
                          the open communities during the production process, and in the validation of the information
                          produced, or made available, by such communities, especially in the case of advices provided by
                          thematic communities, such as the user/consumer support/review communities.</li>

                      <p class="text">This year OpenCERT is collocated with SEFM, so contributions connected to the themes
                        of formal methods and software engineering will be particularly appreciated.
                        In addition to the thematic description provided above, we will be also interested in the
                        following aspects: 
                        <ol class="text">
                          <li><b>Education</b>: open and collaborative approaches in Software Engineering and in Formal Methods education;</li>
                          <li><b>Research</b>: open community research in Formal Methods,
                            formal modelling of learning and collaboration</li>
                          <li><b>Technology</b> integrating Formal Methods technologies and tools within OSS projects
                            as a means for Formal Methods acceptance and diffusion;</li>
